           <p>I'm a Web Developer living in Los Angeles, California.</p>
            <p>As a former professional artist (i.e. writer, actor, oil-painter, musician), I entered the world of Web Development to gain new skills and tools as a creator and become an innovative force within the world of Tech.</p>
           <p>As a people-person and team player, I'm always excited to expand my network of:</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
             <p>Born and raised in Los Angeles, one might've thought I'd have known better than to shoot for the stars. But I did! I gave a professional acting and writing career a shot and did have some success. However, upon becoming a father, I decided to expand my array of talent and expertise beyond filmmaking, focusing the same drive and ambition into the rapidly growing and evolving world of Tech. And I could not be more excited!</p>
              
            <p>As a student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I'm bringing the same passion I have for the arts with me on my journey becoming a Web Developer. I love creating with code!</p>

            <p>If you're currently looking to hire a new Junior Web Developer, or are simply looking to expand your own network within the coding community, feel free to reach out! I'm very excited to work with other coders and professionals to create awesome, inspiring new websites and more!</p>
